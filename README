Installing dependencies:
Assume $basedir is some directory where you're going to check out the
source code.
* cd $basedir
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/sidch/TheaDepsUnix   (Thea
depends on Boost etc which are all here)
* cd TheaDepsUnix/Source
* sudo ./install-defaults.sh --with-wxwidgets --use-root --user
<your-username> --prefix /usr/local -j4
(Replace 4 with the actual number of hardware threads on your system,
typically 2, 4, or 8.)
This will install some libraries by compiling them from source and placing
the result in $prefix, and some libraries with apt-get. Carefully check for
errors (warnings are generally ok). If there are errors, you probably need
to explicitly install some third-party libraries/tools -- see the error
messages -- and rerun the command. Make sure there are no errors in the
output.

Installing the Thea library and bundled tools:
* cd $basedir
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/sidch/Thea
* cd Thea/Code/Build
* cmake .
* make -j4
* make TheaTools -j4
* sudo make install    (puts core Thea libs and headers in /usr/local)
Again check for errors.

This should put a program called Browse3D in
$basedir/Thea/Code/Build/Output/bin. You can use it to view 3D files. Run
it to make sure everything is working properly: try "Browse3D
$basedir/Data/Models/teapot.obj".
Ping me if/when you have problems with any step above. Remember that some
CMake dependency search errors require you to delete the cache
(CMakeCache.txt) and rerun CMake after you install new libraries.

Documentation:
* sudo apt-get install doxygen
* cd Thea/Code/Documentation
* doxygen
* gopen html/index.html
