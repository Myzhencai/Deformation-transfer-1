Installing dependencies:
Assume $basedir is some directory where you're going to check out the
source code.
* cd $basedir
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/sidch/TheaDepsUnix   (Thea
depends on Boost etc whic
h are all here)
* cd TheaDepsUnix/Source
* sudo ./install-defaults.sh --with-wxwidgets --use-root --user
<your-username> --prefix /usr/local -j4
(Replace 4 with the actual number of hardware threads on your system,
typically 2, 4, or 8.)
This will install some libraries by compiling them from source and placing
the result in $prefix, and some libraries with apt-get. Carefully check for
errors (warnings are generally ok). If there are errors, you probably need
to explicitly install some third-party libraries/tools -- see the error
messages -- and rerun the command. Make sure there are no errors in the
output.

Installing the Thea library and bundled tools:
* cd $basedir
* git clone --recursive https://github.com/sidch/Thea
* cd Thea/Code/Build
* cmake .
* Put the Register.cpp file into Thea/Code/Source/Tools/Register/ folder and replace the original file
* make -j4
* make TheaTools -j4
* sudo make install    (puts core Thea libs and headers in /usr/local)
Again check for errors.

This should put a program called Browse3D in
$basedir/Thea/Code/Build/Output/bin. You can use it to view 3D files. Run
it to make sure everything is working properly: try "Browse3D
$basedir/Data/Models/teapot.obj".
Ping me if/when you have problems with any step above. Remember that some
CMake dependency search errors require you to delete the cache
(CMakeCache.txt) and rerun CMake after you install new libraries.

Documentation:
* sudo apt-get install doxygen
* cd Thea/Code/Documentation
* doxygen
* gopen html/index.html


Runnning :

souce mesh : source.off
souce deformed mesh : source_deformed.off
target mesh : target.off
target deformed mesh : target_deformed.off

0) Clone http://github.com/sidch/DGP and copy the DGP/DGP subfolder to src/

1) Open the source and target meshes by running Browse3D tool in Thea/Code/Build/Output/bin
	and select about 70-80 marker points marking corresponding points from both the meshes.
	This will generate 2 files source.picked and target.picked

2)  
	Remove the first line of both source.picked and target.picked files
	Run
	./markers source
	./markers target
	This will bring the .picked files in correct format

3) Put the source.picked and target.picked files in the same folder containing the meshes

4) Run
   ./run.sh source.off source_deformed.off target.off <numpoints>

	<numpoints> is no. of points to sample from source.off which can be around half the no. of faces of source.off for high resolution meshes
